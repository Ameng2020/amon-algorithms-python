My personal journey of algorithm practice using Python.

# Python Algorithm Practice

This is a personal repository for practicing algorithm problems in Python.  
It begins with Microsoft interview questions and will expand to include problems from other top tech companies, common algorithm topics, and data structure mastery.

## üìå Project Goals
- Solve real interview questions with clean Python code
- Build deep understanding of algorithms and data structures
- Track progress and document learning
- Prepare for technical interviews at top companies

## üìÅ Directory Structure
/microsoft/ # Microsoft-specific interview problems
/google/ # (Planned) Google interview questions
/leetcode/ # Common Leetcode-style problems
/data-structures/ # Focused practice on specific data structures
/notes/ # Personal notes, patterns, templates
/utils/ # Reusable tools and helper functions

microsoft/002_merge_intervals.py
google/001_word_ladder.py


## ‚úÖ Features
- Pythonic, well-commented solutions
- Organized by topic or company
- Markdown notes for quick review
- Progress can be tracked with GitHub contributions or README updates

## üöÄ Getting Started
You can browse each directory to explore problems and solutions.  
Each problem is typically saved as a separate `.py` file, with an optional explanation in the corresponding `.md` file.

## üß† Coming Soon
- Add problem tags (e.g., DFS, DP, Greedy, Sliding Window)
- Auto-generate problem list with completion status
- More company-specific sections (e.g., Amazon, Meta)
